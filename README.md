  I'm a self-taught engineer obsessed with building secure, efficient, and fundamentally fair distributed systems from first principles. I founded <a href="https://github.com/zmlAEQ/Aequa-network">Aequa Network</a> to tackle the centralization and MEV problems in L2s with a pragmatic, "Trojan Horse" strategy—first securing existing sequencers, then activating fairness.

<p align="center">
  I build in two domains that look very different but share the same core idea: designing systems—both blockchains and bodies—where incentives, data, and education empower participants instead of trapping them.

### ✨ My Core Vision: Fairness as a Service (FaaS)

I believe **FaaS will be the next crypto consensus**—ensuring bias-free DeFi lending and MEV-proof networks. Aequa Network is engineered to pioneer this paradigm.

- **Modular DVT Engine:** Built in Go for maximum performance and security.
- **Production-Ready:** Architected with strong observability, fail-fast design, and atomic state persistence.
- **Radically Transparent:** Open-source and continuously hardened with long-duration fuzzing, chaos engineering, and comprehensive CI/CD security gates.

### 💪 Motivue: Health Freedom as a System

In parallel to Aequa, I design systems for the human body with the same seriousness I bring to distributed systems.

Through <a href="https://github.com/zmlAEQ/MOTIVUE">Motivue</a>, I developed the **Empowerment & Education Methodology White Paper**, which analyzes why the Chinese private fitness industry often fails clients—and how to fix it.

- **Industry diagnosis:** Sales-first business models, low professional standards, and incentive structures that reward selling packages, not delivering results.
- **Scientific foundation:** Deep work in biomechanics, exercise physiology, nutrition science, and behavior change, treating the body as a measurable, improvable system—not a black box.
- **Education-first methodology:** Train clients with the same rigor we train coaches—teaching the “why” behind every stimulus, using theory, data tracking, and structured feedback loops.
- **The empowerment loop:** Education → Training → Feedback → Review, repeated until clients can read their own data, program their own training, and make independent health decisions.
- **Ultimate goal:** Health freedom—clients “graduate” from dependence on any coach or gym and own the knowledge to manage their bodies for life.

### 🧠 What I'm Exploring

- **Layer 2 Infrastructure:** Architecting the next generation of scalable and decentralized L2 solutions, from P2P networking to novel consensus mechanisms.
- **Applied Cryptography & Privacy:** Implementing cryptographic primitives to build secure, privacy-preserving systems, such as leveraging encryption to eliminate front-running (BEAST-MEV).
- **Game Theory & Mechanism Design:** Modeling incentive systems (like Dual Flow Batch Auctions) to create fair and manipulation-resistant economic protocols.
- **AI & Distributed Systems:** Building intelligent, autonomous multi-agent systems with frameworks like LangGraph to enhance decentralized protocols.
- **AI for Sport & Data-Driven Coaching:** Applying ML and data analysis to strength training, movement quality, and long-term health metrics—my company offers AI4Sport and analytics-driven coaching solutions for gyms, coaches, and product teams.
- **Wireless RF Control & Embedded Systems:** Long-term R&D around 315 MHz and 433 MHz RF solutions, feeding into the dedicated company work described below.

### 🛰️ RF & Remote Control Solutions (My Company)

Alongside software and protocol work, my company has been building **RF remote-control and embedded hardware solutions for 10+ years**, acting as a source provider for low-cost remote-control ICs and complete system designs.

We design and deliver both software and hardware across:

- **Frequencies & IC Platforms**
  - 315 MHz and 433 MHz RF transmission and receiving solutions.
  - Low-cost chip and MCU designs for mass-market applications.
  - HCS301 (KEELOG rolling code) compatible and replacement schemes.
- **Automotive Applications**
  - Car remote controls and central locking systems.
  - Window lifter controllers, sensor-light control, and wiper controllers.
- **E-bike & Motorcycle Systems**
  - E-bike horns, flashers, remote controls, and anti-theft systems.
  - Motorcycle remote controls, alarm systems, flashers, and alarm main units.
- **Home & Industrial Control**
  - Remote switch solutions for home and industrial environments.
  - LED flashing light control and indicator solutions.
  - Battery management and power management circuits for compact devices.

If you are looking for **end-to-end RF remote control solutions (IC + hardware design + firmware)** in these domains, this is work my company actively takes on in addition to my protocol and fitness projects.
